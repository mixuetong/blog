# with语句
高效的作为临时表在from语句中使用，多次在from语句中引用时，with语句仅计算一次。

## 语法
with [recursive] with_query, [...]

## 示例一
with查询：

```
WITH regional_sales AS (
        SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY region
     ), top_regions AS (
        SELECT region
        FROM regional_sales
        WHERE total_sales > (SELECT SUM(total_sales)/10 FROM regional_sales)
     )
SELECT region,
       product,
       SUM(quantity) AS product_units,
       SUM(amount) AS product_sales
FROM orders
WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
GROUP BY region, product;
```

## 示例二
with修改：

```
with t as (select * from test where id=1 for update nowait) 
update test set crt_time=now() from t where t.id=test.id
```
